# spring-cloud-config-files-storage
* This is the microservice config file storage for centralization configuration.
* Nowadays, We used spring cloud config for centralization for all configures at one place over `Git` call config repository (properties or yml files store). 
* Also, we don't need to restart our application again if we changed something in our `application.properties` files or if we want to change something in that config file.
* So, Spring Cloud Config is used for centralized configuration and used to change config at runtime collaborate with Spring boot Actuator build in `Refresh` api. 
* This project is communicate with [Cloud Config Server](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-config-server) for fetching (pulling) config value through that server <br> 
and communicate with [Spring Cloud Config Sample Microservice A](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-config-sample-microservice-a) as for config sample client service <br>
and communicate with [Spring Cloud Config Sample Microservice B](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-config-sample-microservice-b) as for another config sample client service.

<a name="about-the-project"></a>
## ‚ö°Ô∏èAbout The Project
This is Demo repository for Spring Cloud Config file storage. <br>
This config file storage is for all appliactions as centralization and [cloud config server](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-config-server) will fetch desire application properties from this repository through `Git`.<br>
So, firstly, you need to put `application.properties` or `yml` for this application to `Github` or `Bitbucket` or you can even use your local config folder which already committed to local git repository. <br>
Here, config file means your application require file like `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

<a name="built-with"></a>
### ü™ì Built With
This project is just application properties or application yml file storage.

<a name="getting-started"></a>
## üî• Getting Started
There is no need to set up anything.

<a name="before-you-begin"></a>
### üîî Before you begin
If you are new in Git, GitHub and new in Spring Boot configuration structure, <br>
You should see basic detail instructions first in here [Spring Boot Application Instruction](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-boot-app-instruction)<br>
If you are not good enough in basic API knowledge with Java Spring Boot and other spring basic knowledge, you should learn below example projects first. <br>
